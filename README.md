# Headlines

The goal of this project is to employ different machine learning, statistical
learning, and NLP methods and algorithms to classify whether a financial news
headline has a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price of its
associated symbols.

Project uses data from [Alpaca API](https://alpaca.markets/), and employs the
following custom library I've made for interacting with the API:
