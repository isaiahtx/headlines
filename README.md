# Headlines

The goal of this project is to employ different machine learning, statistical
learning, and NLP methods and algorithms to classify whether a financial news
headline has a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price of its
associated symbols.

This project gets its data from the [Alpaca Markets
API](https://docs.alpaca.markets/), which is free to use. In order to download
said data, I am employing a small wrapper I have made called
[Alpaca-API](https://github.com/isaiahtx/alpaca-api)
